# API REST for a weather app with diaries
# Project Description

## Introduction
This project is a TypeScript-based backend application that integrates with MongoDB. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a frontend application for weather visualization. The backend follows best practices, utilizing Node.js and Express.js to provide a robust and efficient server-side solution.

## Features
- MongoDB Integration: Seamlessly connect to a MongoDB database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Weather Data Management: Handle weather data to provide relevant information to the frontend application.
- TypeScript Development: Leverage the power of TypeScript to build a scalable and maintainable backend codebase.
- Node.js and Express.js: Utilize the popular Node.js runtime and Express.js framework for efficient backend development.

## Technologies Used
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, offering enhanced productivity and maintainability.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, providing robust routing and middleware features.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Frontend Integration: The backend is designed to seamlessly integrate with a frontend application for weather visualization.

## Development
The backend application is developed using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js. MongoDB is used as the database for efficient data management. Continuous updates and improvements will be made throughout the development process.
